<h1>Stop!</h1>
<p>You lift up the baby carefully, tucking it into your jacket as best as you can to shield it from the wind. It doesn't make a sound until you start to leave the clearing and make your way back to the park rangers. You hear a shout and distressed screaming behind you. Before you can turn around, the baby is snatched from your arms and a dull pain erupts at the back of your head. Ouch!</p>
