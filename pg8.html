<p>What do you think you're doing?! That baby was clearly being supervised by this family! I could get you fired for this attempted kidnapping!</p>

<p>Your head really hurts, you can't totally process the events of what just occurred. The park ranger is furious at your easy mistake; it's not likely you'll last until the end of the week... Better start looking for another job.</p>
